# AV_TrafficDetectionModel
Created Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Sign Detection model that uses Faster-RCNN to classify 20 different traffic signs and create a bounding box around the sign. Unable to fully train model due to computational limitations, but model accurately detects signs after 1-2 epochs of training. Used Traffic Sign Dataset on Kaggle to train model.
